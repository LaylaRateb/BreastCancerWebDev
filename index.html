      <h3>What do people who are diagnosed with breast cancer have in common?</h3>
      <p>People affected by breast cancer typically exhibit a common feature characterized by genetic variations, commonly referred to as mutations, present in the DNA of their breast cells. DNA, serving as the foundational genetic material of cells, functions as a blueprint containing directives that dictate the regulation of cell growth, governing both the initiation and cessation of cellular proliferation.</p>

      <h3>Can breast cancer survivors live long lives?</h3>
      <p>Survivors of breast cancer can indeed lead long and fulfilling lives post-diagnosis and treatment. As per a recent report by the American Cancer Society (2019‚Äì2020), the relative survival rate over a 15-year period for individuals with breast cancer stands at 80%.</p>

      <p>However, the long-term survival prospects vary considerably depending on the stage of the cancer. For instance, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) indicates that the percentage of individuals surviving ten years or more with distant breast cancer is less than 15%. Nevertheless, ongoing advancements in treatment options offer hope for improved outcomes in cases of distant breast cancer.</p>

      <h3>How common is breast cancer in the United states?</h3>
      <p>In the United States, the population of women with a breast cancer history surpasses four million, encompassing those undergoing treatment and those who have completed it.</p>
